**A Detective Game for Developers Who've Been There**

> *"Recommended 10/10 by System Administrators"*  
> *"Finally, a game that captures the true DevOps experience!"*

## 🎮 Game Overview

Welcome to the most realistic simulation of corporate IT life ever created! Experience the thrill of hunting down missing Docker images while your production builds fail and the CEO's patience runs thin.

### 🎯 Objective
You're a developer detective investigating the mysterious disappearance of critical Docker images from your company's registry. The builds are failing, production is down, and you have exactly 5 minutes to:

1. **Investigate clue areas** to gather evidence
2. **Identify the culprit** among three suspicious sysadmins
3. **Make your accusation** before the CEO notices the outage
4. **Restore the missing dependencies** and save the day!

## 🕵️ The Suspects
